    "First things first, let's talk about Machine Learning. In a nutshell, machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Imagine teaching your dog to fetch; you show it how to do it a few times, and after that, it just gets it, right? Well, machine learning is a bit like that, but instead of teaching dogs, we're training computers! We feed them data (like images, texts, numbers), they analyze this data, learn from it, and then they can make predictions or decisions based on what they've learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are about to embark on the first step of our machine learning project: capturing images of emotions. There are five basic emotions we're interested in: Disgust, Sadness, Joy, Fear, and Anger. **Here's where it gets interesting** - **each team gets to choose two emotions out of these five for their project**. You might be wondering, why just two? Good question! By focusing on two emotions, we can dive deeper into the nuances of these emotions and how to capture them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we dive into capturing images, let's play a quick game to grasp an important concept in Machine Learning - Data Classification."
